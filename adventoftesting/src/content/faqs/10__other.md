Thanks for asking! If you haven’t already, check out [Advent of CSS](http://adventofcss.com).

We also have a course, built specifically around Svelte, [Everything Svelte](https://everythingsvelte.com).

Amy has been working on [Learn with Redwood](https://learnwithredwood.com), a course all about helping you become a full-stack developer. Together, we build a full-stack application, called Rotten Ratings (a Rotten Tomatoes knock-off),

We also have some other irons in the fire for 2023. Feel free to visit the landing pages and express your interest. – This really does help us gauge interest:

- [100 Days of Code]() -
- [CSS Advanced Beginner]() - Know just enough to be dangerous? Convert that knowledge into dangerously awesome. The logic that goes into CSS is different than any other web technology. Stop panicking
- [Frontend Blitz](https://selfteachme.ck.page/076f80dd68) -
- [Projects for Developers]() - They say the best way to learn new things is to build things. But, what do you build? This project aims to provide all the details (developer stories complete with acceptance criteria and Figma designs), just like you're working on a real development team.
- [Know Node.js](https://selfteachme.ck.page/942f374ebd) -
