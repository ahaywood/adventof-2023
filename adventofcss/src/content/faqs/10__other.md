Thanks for asking! If you haven’t already, check out [Advent of JS](http://adventofjs.com).

I also have a course, built specifically around Svelte, [Everything Svelte](https://everythingsvelte.com).

I have some other irons in the fire for 2024. Feel free to visit the landing pages and express your interest. – This really does help us gauge interest:

- [Part Time Startup Club](https://selfteachme.ck.page/ec1b6fbf68) - This is probably the thing that I'm most excited about in 2024. I'll be working with an inaugural cohort to build a startup from scratch. I'll be providing guidance and mentorship along the way. This is a 6-month program. If you're interested, please [express your interest](https://selfteachme.ck.page/33458e4380).
- [100 Days of Code](https://100daysofcode.dev) - Let's code 100 different challenges in 100 days. Just think, if you improve 1% each day, after 100 days, you'll be 100% better developer! We'll tackle a variety of problems that cover HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript problems. I'll provide all the assets you need and help along the way.
- [CSS Advanced Beginner](https://selfteachme.ck.page/33458e4380) - Know just enough to be dangerous? Convert that knowledge into dangerously awesome. The logic that goes into CSS is different than any other web technology. Stop panicking.
- [Projects for Developers](https://projectsfordev.com) - They say the best way to learn new things is to build things. But, what do you build? This project aims to provide all the details (developer stories complete with acceptance criteria and Figma designs), just like you're working on a real development team.
