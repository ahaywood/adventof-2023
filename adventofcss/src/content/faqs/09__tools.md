I work off a 16" M2 MacBook Pro.

For design work, I use [Figma](http://figma.com).

For development, I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I have it tricked out with [plenty of extensions](https://selfteachme.hashnode.dev/65-vs-code-extensions). I also like [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/).
