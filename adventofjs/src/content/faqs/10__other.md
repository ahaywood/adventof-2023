Thanks for asking! If you haven’t already, check out [Advent of CSS](http://adventofcss.com).

I also have a course, built specifically around Svelte, [Everything Svelte](https://everythingsvelte.com).

I also have some other irons in the fire for 2024. Feel free to visit the landing pages and express your interest. – This really does help us gauge interest:

- [Part Time Startup Club](https://selfteachme.ck.page/ec1b6fbf68) -This is probably the thing that I'm most excited about in 2024. I'll be working with an inaugural cohort to build a startup from scratch. I'll be providing guidance and mentorship along the way. This is a 6-month program. If you're interested, please [express your interest](https://selfteachme.ck.page/33458e4380).
- [App from Scratch](https://appfromscratch.academy) - I'm developing a comprehensive web application course that eliminates overwhelm. Join me and gain real-world experience by observing my process. The course covers the entire lifecycle, including idea validation, discovery, design, project management, frontend and backend development, testing, and launch. Everything you need in a single place.
- [CSS Advanced Beginner](https://selfteachme.ck.page/33458e4380) - Know just enough to be dangerous? Convert that knowledge into dangerously awesome. The logic that goes into CSS is different than any other web technology. Stop panicking
- [Projects for Developers](https://projectsfordev.com) - They say the best way to learn new things is to build things. But, what do you build? This project aims to provide all the details (developer stories complete with acceptance criteria and Figma designs), just like you're working on a real development team.
